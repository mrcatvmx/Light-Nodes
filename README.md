Ramanode-Guides
As Ramanode, I stand at the intersection of blockchain technology and seasoned IT expertise. With a solid foundation in IT technologies that spans more than 10 years, my foray into blockchain began in 2021. I maintain a state-of-the-art data center with local servers and robust cloud services to ensure seamless node operation.

My commitment to the blockchain space is demonstrated by my support for projects through every stageâ€”from development and testing phases to testnet and mainnet launches. In my main professional capacity as a software engineer and a crypto exchange specialist, I have a passion for developing dapps that play a crucial role during the testnet phase.

Known for being a dedicated web3 enthusiast, I have engaged with numerous testnets and blockchain nodes over the past two years, exploring platforms like Sei, Sui, Aptos, and others. This hands-on experience in web3, coupled with my career as a software engineer, positions me as a trusted and innovative figure in the blockchain community.

Where to Find Me?
I am mostly active on my Telegram channel, where I share everything about crypto, such as airdrops, testnets, and more.
